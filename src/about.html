        <h2>Bryan</h2>
        <p>One time when I was paired with Bryan on discord he was talking to his cat and I swear the cat answered in
          perfect english. I SWEAR! He acts like it didn't happen. And it was just the two of us so there were no
          witnesses. So I just have to live with that, I guess.</p>

        <h2>Chloe</h2>
        <p>Chloe is last surviving member of the group that invented the sticky note. The rest of the team disappeared.
          I know she's involved. I just can't prove it...yet.</p>

        <h2>Richelle</h2>
        <p>Richelle Thorpe is the star and subject of the 2009 biographical comedy-drama, Julie & Julia. Don't ask her
        about the Oscar snub unless you want a front-row seat to an avalanch of vitriol that, even for adults, is
        pretty shocking.</p>
