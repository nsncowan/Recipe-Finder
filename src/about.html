      <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Bryan</h2>
          <p>One time when I was paired with Bryan on discord he was talking to his cat and I swear the cat answered in perfect english. I SWEAR! He acts like it didn't happen. And it was just the two of us so there were no witnesses. So I just have to live with that, I guess.</p>
        <h2>Chloe</h2>
          <p>Chloe is last surviving member of the group that invented the sticky note. The rest of the team disappeared. I know she's involved. I just can't prove it...yet.</p>
        <h2>Geoff</h2>
          <p>Geoff's doesn't know this, but when I say his name, I'm saying it with a "J".</p>
        <h2>Noah</h2>
          <p>Noah has been coding since before you were born. And before that he was coding since before HE was born. And before that...</p>
        <h2>Richelle</h2>
          <p>Richelle Thorpe is the star and subject of the 2009 biographical comedy-drama, Julie & Julia. Don't ask her about the Oscar snub unless you want a front-row seat to an avalanch of vitriol that, even for adults, is pretty shocking.</p>
